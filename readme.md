Giphy API Example
================

In this project we'll use JQuery and Ajax to make a call to the Giphy API. This will return a JSON that we'll then use to display info/pics in the console.

Tim permitting, we'll explore the following upgrades:

* search functionality
* alert the user if they left the input empty when trying to search
* display search results on DOM
* basic styling
* click an image to remove it from display
